# /etc/portage
My Gentoo GNU/Linux /etc/portage config files.

My motto is "Keep it simple" :)

The system is using GCC as default compiler and Clang as alternate compiler.
Linux kernel is compiled with Clang and LLVM/Clang's ThinLTO feature. 

Aimed for stability over performance, and peformance over security.
